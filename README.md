# adoption-website-team project

This project was developed by me and my team as part of a university assignment. The idea was to build a simple yet functional website for pet adoption, where users can view and adopt pets.

Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL

My Role:
I was responsible for creating and designing the Home Page (index), connecting it to the database, and managing the backend database operations. This included:
- Fetching dynamic data from the database and displaying it on the homepage.
- Writing PHP scripts for database interaction.
- Designing and maintaining the structure of the database.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in front-end and back-end integration, as well as working in a team to complete a real-world web system.
